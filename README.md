# Code Refactor Starter Code
DESCRIPTION:
Here we have the new Horiseon website with a freshly refactored code.  
Adjustments have been made to improve the accessibility of the site and  
the organization of the code itself. I have included a screenshot and   
link to the deployed site along with the User Story, Acceptance Criteria  
and a list of my changes below.
